- 👋 Hi, I’m @g-beier : a math's teacher learning Web Development in practice.
- 👀 I’m interested in Galois Theory, Commutative Algebra and Differential Calculus (joking, just got over it).
- 🌱 I’m started learning Vue.js, but now I work with React. I also keep my Scout Group's website in Astro.
- ☕ Got a touch of Java, and didn't die.
- 🐍 Python is just for math I don't want to do, and I need to recall the syntax everytime.
